# Converter-Parts-List

A lightweight, responsive web application for selecting and viewing spare parts for ABB DCS500B and DCS600 converter modules based on input voltage and current ratings.

## 🔧 Project Purpose

This tool is designed to help technicians, engineers, and maintenance personnel quickly identify and locate spare parts needed for ABB converters (DCS500B/DCS600 series). By simply selecting the voltage and ampere rating, users can instantly view a list of corresponding components like thyristor modules, fuses, power boards, and cooling fans.
